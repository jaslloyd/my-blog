Another year is here and it's time for me to write my goals for 2020. This is the 3rd year I am writing a post about my goals. This year I am going to try to use the momentum/motivation I have going into the new year to try to accomplish as many of these goals as I can as quick as I can. The idea of trying to do it as quick as possible is that "we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year". Anyway, I have 4 goals for "year" and I have tried to make the Goals S.M.A.R.T:

> S.M.A.R.T - **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**ealistic, and **T**imely

## Goals

**Goal**: Promotion to Staff Software Engineer  
**How it will be measured**: Well I will either be it or not be it at the end of the year.  
**Due Date:** I want this to be done by at the latest middle of the year July / August  
**Next Steps:** Let my manager(s) know my aspirations and give them a set of steps to achieve the goal. (Which the specific steps are private and related to the company I work for).

**Goal**: Publish 12 Blog Posts  
**How it will be measured**: As long as I am writing at least one post per month I know I am on track.  
**Due Date**: 31/12/2020  
**Next Steps:** Already started this**,** I have a few already scheduled for January including this one.

**Goal**: Read 12 non-fiction Books  
**How it will be measured**: As long as I am reading at least one book per month I should be fine. Also, 12 is the perfect amount I may even read less as I want to apply more of the principles I have learned instead of just reading about it.  
**Due Date**: 31/12/2020  
**Next Steps:** Already have an audible subscription, I also have started compiling the list of books I want to read this year.

**Goal**: Complete at least 30 - 50 Leet Code Questions  
**How it will be measured**: As long as I can complete at least 4 questions per month I should be able to stay on track.  
**Due Date**: 30/11/2020  
**Next Steps:** Login to my Leetcode account, might create a brand new account to make sure I have nothing on there.  
**Special Note**: I am doing this because I feel like the skills that Leet Code questions test are not tested everyday development but they can teach you a lot about programming.

## Conclusion

Well, there are my self-development goals for 2020, as stated I am going to try to complete these goals as quickly as I can as a bit of a challenge to myself. The realistic due date is attached to the Goals but this is really just a placeholder. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the post, let me know what your self-development goals for 2020 are.

Good luck and until next time

Jason
