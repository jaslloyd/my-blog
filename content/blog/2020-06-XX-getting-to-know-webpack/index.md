## What is webpack

> At its core webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

Why is webpack Required? - That is a great question and I think the webpack team has done a great job explaining it [here](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/why-webpack/)

Webpack has about 6 core concepts:

- Entry
- Output
- Loaders
- Plugins
- Mode
- Browser Compatibility

We are going to dive into each of these concept as we build out own webpack.config file, I think this is the best way to understand webpack.

// Why we need webpack
// Why I am looking into it now
// Brief overview of what we are going to do with it, (Get react working with it)
// Starter project, Hello world webpack
// Webpack, webpack-cli. webpack-dev-server
// Simple webpack config with index.js, hello world
// Bringing in React (Loaders)
// Bringing in Typescript (Loaders)
// Getting it semi-Production Ready (Plugins e.g Minification, Uglyify js)
// Challenge CRA Web pack configuration
// Next Steps Detailed look at CRA webpack config file.
