Its been a more than a year since my last post, I mistakenly took more than a year break to writing blog posts mainly because I got a brunt out with the pandemic, lockdowns and being made redundant at my position at Walmart so let's give a little bit of an life update.

- Living: Currently / Still in Dublin, Ireland
- Job: I am now working at Workday as a UI lead / Senior Tech lead n the Learning team working on Workday Learning Management (LMS) product using Javascript, React and GraphQL. I have been loving working on such a complex and large product and I am excited for the future of the product.
