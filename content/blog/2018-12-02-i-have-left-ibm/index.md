Welcome back guys, it has been a while since I have posted it has been a very busy three months for me, I am excited to give you guys some news. A few weeks ago I had my last day at IBM, I have moved to a new company.

I am happy to announce that I have joined Jet.com as a Senior Software Engineer. It will be a Web Development position mainly focusing on Front-end.

I am very excited to be moving on and excited to get be getting started. I will be hopefully posting more regularly on this from now on as all the interviewing and other stuff is out of the way.
