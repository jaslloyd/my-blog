Welcome back, one of my Self Development Goals for 2021 is "Complete at least 25 - 50 Leetcode Questions" so why not get this goal started right away. Leetcode has a huge question bank of questions so what questions have I decided to answer? Looking around online there seems to be different opinions on what do focus on and whilst there is no definitive answer some good advice I found is to generally look at different areas / Techniques e.g: Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Binary Search, Graphs (DFS, BFS), Trie etc. The first area I have decided to focus on is Arrays / Two pointers as they seem to closely related in a lot of problems.
