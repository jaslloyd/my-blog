This is part 3 of our webpack tutorial, we are exploring building out our own webpack config file to better understand what some tools like create react app are doing under the hood. Today we are going to making our webpack config more production ready. Lets get started.

// Development mode vs Production mode / using TerserPlugin for better miniifcation
// OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin for css cleanup
// Switching from public to build like CRA
// source maps
// Code Splitting, hashing and other techniques
// Clean our build folder
// Challenge Review CRA : https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/c87ab79559e98a5dae2cd0b02477c38ff6113e6a/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js
// Alternatives, tools (https://createapp.dev/) and resources
// Conclusion
