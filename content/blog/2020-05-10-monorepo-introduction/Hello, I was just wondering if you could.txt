Hello, I was just wondering if you could help me with a quick question. I want to get into investing more and I was wondering about CGT on profit and losses. Here are some examples:

Let's say I buy 5 shares at €200 each, and a year or so later I sell the all the shares at €500 per share. If I look at the guidelines the tax works out like this:

Sold - 2500 (500 x 5) 

Purchase - 1000 ($200 x 5)

Gain = 1,500

Exemption -1270 (saying I had full exemption)

Tax payable = 230*33% = 75 CGT

Questions:
1. Are my calculations correct? 
2. How would this change if I purchased these shares at different prices? over the course of the year? e.g 250, 300 etc? Does the FIFO principal apply? 
3. Also in the cases of losses is there a tax credit on the losses? e.g I bought at 200 and sold at 150 for example.

Let me know if I confused you in any way, I just want to make sure I am paying the right tax in the future if I start buying and selling shares.

Thank you

Jason
