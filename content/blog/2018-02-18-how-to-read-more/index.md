Welcome back guys, in the last few weeks I have found myself reading a lot more Technical Articles and today I stopped and asked myself why all of a sudden I was reading these articles? After thinking about it for 10 minutes I figured out what was causing it and this is what I want to discuss today. How to read more technical articles or read more in general without realizing it.

### Tip #1 - Remove All Social Media

This might seem a bit generic but every since removing All/Most of the social media apps on my phone it has been a lot harder to procrastinate. When I have a bit of free-time or I am waiting for something it was easy to open up Facebook, Twitter or whatever and waste time. This brings me to Tip #2.

### Tip #2 - Install the Medium App on your phone

Initially, I was very skeptic about Medium and the quality of the content on there but I think I have found the saving feature, you can follow organisations or specific people. This might not seem obvious if you are just finding random articles on Medium from google searches but in my opinion, it is mediums best feature. Ever since installing the application on my phone and I have had a bit of free time I just open the Medium app and start reading a random technical article instead of opening a social media app. This way I am learning something interesting/new and I am improving my overall knowledge rather than wasting time.

If you want to get a quick start here are two good articles I recently read:

- [Understand Javascript Closures](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-javascript-closures-4188edf5ea1b)
- [Evolving Patterns in React](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/evolving-patterns-in-react-116140e5fe8f)

That is it for this short article, although the title and opening might seem very click-bait it is the honest truth for me and I hope these tips will allow you to read more articles. If you find yourself reading more articles because of this please share with your friends and let them know it helped :)

Until next time,

Jason
