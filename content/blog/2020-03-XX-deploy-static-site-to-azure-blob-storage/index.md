Welcome back, in the last series of posts we discussed migrating a Wordpress blog to Gatsby and then we deployed it to Netlify. While I personally think Netlify is the best platform to deploy a static website there are alternatives. Today I am going to be discussing Azure Blob Storage.

## Azure

- What it is
- Signing up for a free account

### Blob Storage

- What is a resource Group, Creating a resource group
- What is a storage account, Creating a storage account inside the resource group.
- Enabling static web hosting on our blob storage
- Update a sample index.html
- TIL on azure command line and uploading a whole application.
