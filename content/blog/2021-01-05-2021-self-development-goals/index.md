Another year is here and it's time for me to write my goals for 2021. This is the 4th year I am writing a post about my goals.

## Goals

**Goal**: Promotion to Staff Software Engineer  
**How it will be measured**: Well I will either be it or not be it at the end of the year.  
**Due Date:** I want this to be done by at the latest middle of the year so around July / August  
**Next Steps:** Follow the regular promotion process for my company!

**Goal**: Publish 35 Blog Posts  
**How it will be measured**: As long as I am writing at least 3 posts per month I know I am on track.  
**Due Date**: December 2021
**Next Steps:** **Already started this** I have a few already scheduled for January including this one.

**Goal**: Read 4 amount of Software books, Read 6 other non fiction Books
**How it will be measured**: I am looking to write blog posts on some of books I read, the book I am currently reading "Designing Data-Intensive applications".
**Due Date**: December 2021
**Next Steps:** Gather a list of books I tend on reading in the next few months.

**Goal**: Complete at least 25 - 50 Leetcode Questions
**How it will be measured**: Leetcode shows how many problems you have solved at the end of the year I can take this number. I also planning on blogging about some of the leetcode problems I solve as another way to keep me accountable.
**Due Date**: December 2021
**Next Steps:** Already have account setup with some problems.
**Special Note**: I am doing this because I feel like the skills that Leet Code questions test are not tested everyday development but they can teach you a lot about programming.

## Conclusion

Well, there are my public self-development goals for 2021. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the post, let me know what your self-development goals for 2021 are. I plan to write Goal check in posts.

Until next time,

Jason
