Over past few months I have been using the [Atom Editor](http://atom.io) almost exclusively, today I wanted to share my favourite Atom packages/plugins that are actually useful. I work with a variety of programming languages so there will be something for everybody.

## General

[Sunset](https://github.com/codeimpossible/sunset) - Are you a developer that likes a white editor during day time and a dark editor during night time? Well Sunset is the only package you need.

[File-icons](https://github.com/file-icons/atom) - I personally hate the default icons in Atom, they are all the same and just ugly well this solves that problem.

[Linter](https://github.com/steelbrain/linter) \- An essential part of programming is having your IDE provide feedback as you are programming and Linters provide that ability. This is the base package that all linters use. I will get into language specific linters further down.

[minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) \- A preview of the full source code that is easy to scroll.

[terminal-plus/platformio-ide-terminal](https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal) - At the time of writing this terminal-plus doesn't work on windows and seems to be  abandoned so I recommend platformio-ide-terminal. It bring the terminal to Atom without leaving your editor, it's awesome especially for NodeJS apps.

[split-diff](https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff) - A split pane to show you the difference between two files.

[atom-beautify](https://github.com/Glavin001/atom-beautify) - Awesome package that helps "beautify" a bunch of languages inside atom.

## Web Development

[linter-jshint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-jshint) - Best JavaScript Linter I have come across helps you identify potential issues in your code.

[atom-jade](https://github.com/merrihew/atom-jade) - Add Jade language support in atom

[jade-autocompile](https://atom.io/packages/jade-autocompile) - I love using jade, one problem I have is I got so used to using jade that I rarely write in html anymore. I wanted to write in jade and have it auto compiled to html well this package does that.

## Python Packages

[autocomplete-python](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python) - Auto complete for python extremely useful.

[python-tools](https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/python-tools) - I got use to double clicking in Java to go to the definition and I missed it in python well this provides that ability in python. It also show the usages of packages and function as well as more.

[linter-pylint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-pylint) - Linter for python this goes well with the pep8 pip package.

## Misc languages Packages

[language-batch](https://atom.io/packages/language-batch) - Adds Syntax highlighting for Windows batch files
