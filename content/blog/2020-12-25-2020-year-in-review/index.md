Welcome back, earlier in Jan of this year I published a post about my [2020: Self Development Goals](./2020-01-05-2020-self-development-goals/index.md), little did I know just one month later Covid came and we were put in a lock down that is pretty much still ongoing. I hope you are doing well and staying safe, lets discuss how my 2020 went.

## Goals

**Goal**: Promotion to Staff Software Engineer  
**Outcome**: Not Achieved - I didn't achieve this, I did let my manager know about my ambitions but Covid kinda threw most Hiring / Promotion plans out the window. This will be a Goal I continue to in 2021 and hope I can get it through.

**Goal**: Publish 12 Blog Posts  
**Outcome**: Achieved - At this point I have published 20 Blog posts (including this one), this was a good year for blog posts considering I was extremely busy in my role at Walmart. Ideally I would like to get to publishing at least once per week (52 total) but 20 was good for this year.

**Goal**: Read 12 non-fiction Books
**Outcome**: Achieved - I love books, my audible yearly subscription is something I use to the max every year. Here is a list of books I was able to read this year:

1. Algorithms to live by
2. Mindset - The New Psychology of Success
3. 5 Second Rule - Mel Robins
4. The War of Art - Steven Pressfield
5. The 5am Club -
6. Can't Hurt Me - David Goggins
7. Do the Work - Steven Pressfield
8. The Decision - Kevin Hart
9. The 4 hour work week - Tim Ferris (Re-read)
10. 12 Week Year (Re-read)
11. How will you measure your life
12. // TODO

The best book I read this year was ....

**Goal**: Complete at least 30 - 50 Leet Code Questions
