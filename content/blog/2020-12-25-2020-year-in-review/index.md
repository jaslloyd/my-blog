Welcome back, earlier in Jan of this year I published a post about my [2020: Self Development Goals](./2020-01-05-2020-self-development-goals/index.md), little did I know just one month later Covid came and we were put in a lock down that is pretty much still ongoing. I hope you are doing well and staying safe, lets discuss how my 2020 went.

## Goals

**Goal**: Promotion to Staff Software Engineer  
**Outcome**: Not Achieved - I didn't achieve this, I did let my manager know about my ambitions but Covid kinda threw most Hiring / Promotion plans out the window. This will be a Goal I continue to in 2021 and hope I can get it through.

**Goal**: Publish 12 Blog Posts  
**Outcome**: Achieved - At this point I have published 19 Blog posts (including this one), this was a good year for blog posts considering I was extremely busy in my role at Walmart.

**Goal**: Read 12 non-fiction Books
**Outcome**: Achieved -

**Goal**: Complete at least 30 - 50 Leet Code Questions
**Outcome**: Not Achieved -

## Conclusion

Until next time

Jason
