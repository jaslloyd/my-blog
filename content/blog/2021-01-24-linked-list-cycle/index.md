Welcome back, part of my Self Development Goals for 2021 is "Complete at least 25 - 50 Leetcode Questions", today we are going to discuss and solve [Leetcode Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

## Problem

![Linked List Cycle](./images/linked-list-cycle.png)

## Solution

There are two mains ways to approach this, one using extra space O(n) and a better solution using constant space O(1). We could use a hashmap to store each value then has we go through each value check if its already in the hashmap if it is it contains a cycle. This uses extra space so can we do better? Yes we can we can use two pointers!, if you have followed this leetcode series so far we know we have seen this two pointer technique before so lets discuss it.

## Time / Space Complexity

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this second post on solving some Leetcode problems, Anyway, that is 6 / 25 for my yearly goal done! now onto the rest, i hope you enjoyed this post!

Until next time
